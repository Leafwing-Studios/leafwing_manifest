//! When generating content through a combination of code and assets,
//! it is often useful to be able to quickly spawn new instances of objects by name from inside the code.
//!
//! This workflow tends to make the most sense during prototyping, where the exact details of the content are still in flux,
//! or when the content is generated procedurally and the exact details are not known ahead of time.
//! By contrast, traditional "levels" generally make most sense as pure assets,
//! although even then it can be useful to be able to spawn objects by name for scripting purposes:
//! creating effects, dynamically spawning enemies, etc.
//!
//! This example shows how to use manifests to create a simple system for working with manifest entries by name,
//! although the same principles can be used to manipulate manifests if using the [`MutableManifest`] trait as well.
//!
//! This code is largely copied from the `simple.rs` example: we're just adding constants and a new system to demonstrate the name-based lookups.

// While you *can* simply use the name directly via the various name-based methods on the Manifest trait,
// it's generally a good idea to store constants for the names you're going to use when possible.
// This has three main benefits:
// 1. It makes it easier to refactor your code later, as you can change the name in one place and have it propagate everywhere.
// 2. It makes it easier to catch typos, as the compiler will catch any references to a name that doesn't exist.
// 3. It saves on recomputing the hash of the name every time you need it.
